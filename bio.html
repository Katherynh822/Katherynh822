    <h1> Kat on her morning hike, 2021.</h1>
    
    <p>
     I am Kat, a queer artist of Pervuian and Dominican descent, born in Hoboken, NJ. In my youth my family moved often, each new city influencing how I perceived myself and my environment. For as long as I can remember I’ve loved to observe my surroundings. Since childhood, I've realized that I was atypical; I gravitated to the strange, the abstract, and the unique beauty that can be found in places & people. I have been taking photos and doodling on surfaces for as long as I can remember, but it wasn't until beginning to work in customer service at a large camera store that I was able to learn the ins-and-outs of the techniques and tools of photography. It was during this time that I picked up my first "real" camera and began to pursue photography as a passion. Working in Manhattan, I got to see new things every single day, and so I began shooting everything I could, getting practice while starting to understand and develop my personal style. In short, I started to document my life in an attempt to give my perspective on the world around me as I see it. As my confidence grew in photography, so did my illustrations, inspired by how i took phtos and how I wanted my reality took look like or how my reality felt. I see beauty, a story, and emotion wherever my eye wanders. With my photography, I am trying to freeze that feeling, that moment in time. I want each viewer to have their own perspective when viewing my work. Graphic design is my new love and I am very proud with how far ive come in a span of almost 2 years. Cant wait to see more growth and learn more.
